# Instructions for Running the Visualization Locally


Please follow these step-by-step instructions to view the visualization website on your computer:

Download the Project Files:

Download the project files (in a ZIP format) from the provided link.
Unzip the downloaded folder to a location on your computer.
Install a Web Browser:

Ensure you have a modern web browser installed, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Install Python (Optional):

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, please download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. (Note: This step is optional and only required if you want to run a local server.)
Running the Local Server (Optional):

Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS) on your computer.
Navigate to the unzipped project folder using the cd command, followed by the folder path.
Type python -m http.server (for Python 3.x) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for Python 2.x) and press Enter. This will start a local server.
You will see a message similar to: "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..."
View the Visualization Website:

Open your preferred web browser. If you're not running a local server, navigate to the unzipped project folder and open the "index.html" file with your web browser.
You should now see the visualization website running locally on your computer.
