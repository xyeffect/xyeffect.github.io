# Instructions for Running the Visualization Locally


Please follow these step-by-step instructions to view the visualization website on your computer:

Download the Project Files:

Download the project files (in a ZIP format) from the provided link.
Unzip the downloaded folder to a location on your computer.
Install a Web Browser:

Ensure you have a modern web browser installed, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Install Python (Optional):

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, please download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. (Note: This step is optional and only required if you want to run a local server.)
Running the Local Server (Optional):

Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS) on your computer.
Navigate to the unzipped project folder using the cd command, followed by the folder path.
Type python -m http.server (for Python 3.x) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for Python 2.x) and press Enter. This will start a local server.
You will see a message similar to: "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..."
View the Visualization Website:

Open your preferred web browser.
If you're running a local server, type http://localhost:8000 in the address bar and press Enter. If you're not running a local server, navigate to the unzipped project folder and open the "index.html" file with your web browser.
You should now see the visualization website running locally on your computer.
Files Included in the Project:

index.html: The main HTML file that displays the visualization website.

script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for rendering the visualizations and handling interactivity.
